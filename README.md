*Project 1: Deaths by tuberculosis
by Michel Wermelinger, 14 July 2015, with minor edits on 5 April 2016

This is the project notebook for Week 1 of The Open University's Learn to code for Data Analysis course.

In 2000, the United Nations set eight Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) to reduce poverty and diseases, improve gender equality and environmental sustainability, etc. Each goal is quantified and time-bound, to be achieved by the end of 2015. Goal 6 is to have halted and started reversing the spread of HIV, malaria and tuberculosis (TB). TB doesn't make headlines like Ebola, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and other epidemics, but is far deadlier. For more information, see the World Health Organisation (WHO) page http://www.who.int/gho/tb/en/.

**Remember
If you want to execute the project, you should have installed the Anaconda package 3 with IPython Notebook.
